# Intro to JS Track

## Getting Started

```bash
git clone https://github.com/mcrcodes/intro-to-js
cd intro-to-js
npm install
npm start
```

## Adding Pages

Pages can be added by visiting `/crud`. Existing pages can be updated by visiting `/crud/:pageId`. There isn't any feedback for successful CRUD operations, and the application isn't reactive, so you will need to refresh.

## Data Store

Data is stored in Firebases' Firestore. You can specify the API key in a .env file (see .env.example).
